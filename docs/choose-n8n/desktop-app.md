# Desktop (removed)

The Desktop app was designed as a quick way to try out n8n, without installing other dependencies.

## Ending support

As of May 2023, n8n has sunsetted the Desktop app. This decision aimed to prioritize resources and focus. You can read more about this decision in a [forum post by the CEO](https://community.n8n.io/t/sunsetting-self-hosted-team-plan-desktop-version/25830){:target=_blank .external-link}.

You can view and fork the source code in the [n8n-desktop-app](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-desktop-app){:target=_blank .external-link} repository.

## Alternatives

You can choose to:

* Use [n8n Cloud](/choose-n8n/cloud/), the hosted service.
* Install with [npm](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/) or [Docker](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/) on your local machine.
* Host n8n on your own servers or cloud hosting provider. Refer to our [server setup](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/server-setups/){:target=_blank .external-link} guides.
