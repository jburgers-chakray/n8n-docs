# Cookbook

n8n's coding cookbook is a collection of recipes, or examples, showing what you can do with code in n8n.

The examples are split into three groups:

* [Built-in methods and variables](/code/cookbook/builtin/): examples showing basic usage of some of n8n's [built-in methods and variables](/code/builtin/).
* [Expressions](/code/cookbook/expressions/): recipes for use in the [expressions editor](/code/expressions/).
* [Code node](/code/cookbook/code-node/): recipes for use in the [Code node](/code/cookbook/code-node/).
