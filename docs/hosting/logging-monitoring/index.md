# Logging and monitoring

n8n provides options for self-hosted users to produce logs and monitor the health of their instance:

* [Logging](/hosting/logging-monitoring/logging/): logs to debug your instance, built on the [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston){:target=_blank .external-link} logging library.
* [Log streaming](/log-streaming/): for Enterprise tier.
* [Monitoring](/hosting/logging-monitoring/monitoring/): use the `/metrics` endpoint to get information about the current status of the instance.
