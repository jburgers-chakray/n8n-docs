# Community nodes

n8n provides hundreds of built-in nodes. It also supports users [creating their own nodes](/integrations/creating-nodes/). These are community nodes. 

The community nodes repository allows users who create nodes to publish them to npm. These nodes are then available to install and use in your n8n instance.

/// note | Only available on self-hosted instances
Community nodes are not available on n8n cloud and require [self-hosting](/hosting/) n8n.
