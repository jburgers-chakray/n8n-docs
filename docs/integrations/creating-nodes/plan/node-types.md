# Node types: Trigger and Action

There are two node types you can build for n8n: app nodes and trigger nodes.

Both types provide integrations with external services. 

## Trigger nodes

Trigger nodes start a workflow and supply the initial data. A workflow can contain multiple trigger nodes but with each execution, only one of them will execute, depending on the triggering event.

## Action nodes

Action nodes perform operations as part of your workflow. These can include manipulating data, and triggering events in other systems.
