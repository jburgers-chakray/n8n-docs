# Execute Workflow

Use the Execute Workflow node to run a different workflow on the host machine that runs n8n.

/// note | Examples and templates
For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Execute Workflow integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/execute-workflow/){:target=_blank .external-link} page.

## Properties

The Execute Workflow node has two properties:

- **Source**: this field specifies from where to get the workflow's information.
	- Database
	- Local File
	- Parameter
	- URL
- **Workflow**: this field contains information about the workflow, such as the workflow ID, URL, or a file.
- **Mode**: choose whether to **Run once with all items** or **Run once for each item**. Selecting **Run once for each item** makes the node execute for every input item in turn.

## Set up and use a sub-workflow

This section walks through setting up both the parent workflow and sub-workflow.

## Find a workflow ID

1. Open the workflow for which you want to get the workflow ID.
2. Copy the number after `workflow/` in your URL and paste that in the **Workflow ID** field.
