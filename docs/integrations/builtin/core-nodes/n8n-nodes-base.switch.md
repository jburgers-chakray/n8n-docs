# Switch

Use the Switch node to route a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations. It's similar to the [IF](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) node, but supports multiple output routes.

/// note | Examples and templates
For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Switch integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/switch/){:target=_blank .external-link} page.

## Node reference

**Mode**: select whether to define the conditions as rules in the node, or as an expression, programmatically.

**Add Routing Rule**: add comparison conditions using the  dropdown. The available comparison operations vary for each data type:

- Boolean
	- Equal
	- Not Equal
- Number
	- Smaller
	- Smaller Equal
	- Equal
	- Not Equal
	- Larger
	- Larger Equal
- String
	- Contains
	- Equal
	- Not Contains
	- Not Equal
	- Regex

**Fallback Output**: choose how to route the workflow when none of the conditions match.
