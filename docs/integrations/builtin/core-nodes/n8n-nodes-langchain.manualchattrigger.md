## Usage

Use this node to start a workflow with a chat session. This node is part of the LangChain feature. You can use it with the [Conversational Agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/).

After adding the Manual Chat Trigger to your workflow, n8n displays the **Chat** button. Use this instead of **Execute Workflow** to test your workflow.
