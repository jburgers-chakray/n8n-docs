# OpenAI credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes with OpenAI.

- [OpenAI](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.openai/)
- [Chat OpenAI](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatopenai)
- [Embeddings OpenAI](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsopenai)
- [LM OpenAI](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmopenai)

You need an OpenAI account. OpenAI uses API keys. Log in to your account, then go to your [API keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys){:target=_blank .external-link} to create your key.

Once you have your key, copy it into **API Key** in the credentials modal in n8n.
