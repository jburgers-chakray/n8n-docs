Parameters for **Get Many**:

* Memory Key: the key to use to store the vector memory in the workflow data. n8n prefixes the key with the workflow ID to avoid collisions.
* Prompt: search query.
* Limit: how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.


Parameters for **Insert Documents**:

* Memory Key
* Clear Store: whether to wipe the vector store for the given memory key for this workflow before inserting data.

Parameters for **Retrieve Documents (For Agent/Chain)**:
