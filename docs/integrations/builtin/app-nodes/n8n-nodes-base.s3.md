# S3

Use the S3 node to automate work in S3, and integrate S3 with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of S3 features, including creating, deleting, and getting buckets, files, and folders. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the S3 node supports and links to more resources.

/// note | Credentials
Refer to [S3 credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/s3/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

### Setting file permissions in Wasabi

When uploading files to [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/), permissions for the files must be set using the **ACL** dropdown and not the toggles.
