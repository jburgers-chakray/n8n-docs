### Specify the data type of a column

To specify the data type of a column, append the column name with `:type`, where `type` is the data type of that column. For example, if you want to specify the type `int` for the column *id* and type `text` for the column *name*, you can use the following snippet in the ***Columns*** field: `id:init,name:text`.
