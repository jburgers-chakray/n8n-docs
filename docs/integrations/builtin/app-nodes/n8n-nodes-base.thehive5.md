# TheHive 5

Use the TheHive 5 node to automate work in TheHive, and integrate TheHive with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of TheHive features, including creating alerts, counting tasks logs, cases, and observables. 

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the TheHive node supports and links to more resources.

/// note | TheHive and TheHive 5
n8n provides two nodes for TheHive. Use this node (TheHive 5) if you want to use TheHive's version 5 API. If you want to use version 3 or 4, use [TheHive](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.thehive/).
///
/// note | Credentials
Refer to [TheHive credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/thehive5/) for guidance on setting up authentication. 
///
/// note | Examples and templates
For usage examples and templates to help you get started, take a look at n8n's [TheHive integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/thehive-5/){:target="_blank" .external-link} list.
