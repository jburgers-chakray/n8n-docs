## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to get multiple clients' data from Invoice Ninja. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/534) on this website. This example usage workflow uses the following two nodes.

- [Start](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.start/)
- [Invoice Ninja]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
