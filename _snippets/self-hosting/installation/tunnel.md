## n8n with tunnel

This is only meant for local development and testing. Do not use it in production.

To be able to use webhooks for trigger nodes of external services like GitHub, n8n has to be reachable from the web. To make that easy, n8n has a special [tunnel service](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) which redirects requests from our servers to your local n8n instance.
